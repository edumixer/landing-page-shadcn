# Coopers Landing page ðŸš€

## Overview ðŸŒŒ

This application was developed for study purposes. In this application I used ViteJs for my frontend application. To create my components, I used a library  [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/components/accordion). I used principles such as composition components to reuse components. I used Postgres for the database, which I hosted on a platform [Neon](https://neon.tech/). And finally I used NodeJs to create my backend routes using Express.
